IMPORTANT: Do **not** report active or sensitive security vulnerabilities in a public issue. Follow the private disclosure process in `SECURITY.md`.

If you are **not able to** use the private channel (email) and must create this issue, **do not** include PII, reproduction URLs with secrets, or exploit code. Instead, provide a brief summary and email `security@yourcompany.example` with full details.

## Short summary

A short, non-sensitive summary of the issue (no PII or secret tokens).

## Acknowledgement

- I will **not** post exploit code publicly.
- I will contact the security email or private channel per `SECURITY.md`.

## If you are the security team:

- Move the report to a private channel and follow the organisation vulnerability playbook. See `SECURITY.md`.

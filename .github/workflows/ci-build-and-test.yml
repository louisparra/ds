# What this file is:
# CI job that runs build & test for PRs and pushes. Updated to include a dedicated lint job that runs
# `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` so style/lint issues fail PRs.
# Who should edit it:
# Eng Lead or Infra. Update when linting or formatting commands change.
# When to update (example):
# Update if package.json script names change or you add additional linter steps.
# Who must approve changes:
# Eng Lead and Infra team.

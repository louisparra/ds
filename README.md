# Design System Template — Starter Repo

This repository is a **reusable template** for building a production-ready design system: tokens, components, automation, docs, and governance.

Use this template to:
- Bootstrap a new organization instance of the Design System.
- Provide a complete, discoverable scaffold for designers, engineers, QA and product.

---

## Quick links (where to start)
- **Project config:** `project-config.md` (fill during kickoff)  
- **Roadmap & milestones:** `ROADMAP.md`  
- **Owners & governance:** `OWNERS.md` and `governance/`  
- **Tokens (canonical):** `tokens/tokens.json` 
- **Design view:** `figma/` (Figma mapping files)  
- **Developer view:** `storybook/` and `packages/`

---

## How to use this template (fast path)
1. Create a new branch for your initial edits: `ds/top-level-scaffold`.  
2. Fill `project-config.md` and `OWNERS.md`.  
3. Follow the Roadmap (see `ROADMAP.md`) to implement milestones.

Branching policy: see `/BRANCHING.md`.

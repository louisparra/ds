# Icons — master SVG set

This folder contains the canonical icons (SVG sources), a machine-readable manifest (`icons/manifest.json`), and a small utility script to build a sprite and mapping (`icons/build-sprite.js`).

Purpose

- Provide a canonical, version-controlled set of vector icons designers and engineers can use.
- Enable automated builds (sprite generation, React/SVG component generation, icon registries).

Conventions

- Filenames: `kebab-case` (e.g., `arrow-right.svg`).
- Icon `name` (manifest): dot-friendly, human-friendly (e.g., `icon.arrow.right` or `arrow-right`).
- ViewBox: all icons use a consistent viewBox (24x24 by default) unless otherwise noted.
- Accessibility: each SVG contains a `<title>` element to help screen readers. Consumers should set `aria-hidden` or `aria-label` appropriately.

Usage examples

- In Figma: copy-paste SVG markup or import the `.svg` file as an image and then convert to vectors if needed.
- In web code:
  - Use the sprite generated by `icons/build-sprite.js` or individual optimized SVGs.
  - Prefer `currentColor` fills so icons inherit text color.

Build (developer)

```bash
# from repo root
node icons/build-sprite.js
# Outputs:
# - icons/dist/icons-sprite.svg
# - icons/dist/icons-sprite.json (name -> symbol id, viewBox map)
```

If you plan to add icons

1. Add the optimized SVG into `icons/svgs/` with a `kebab-case` filename.
2. Add an entry into `icons/manifest.json` describing the icon (name, filename, keywords).
3. Run `node icons/build-sprite.js` to regenerate the sprite and mapping.
4. Open a PR describing intended use and request Design System Lead sign-off for new semantic names.

Notes

- SVGs here are source artwork. CI or build tasks may further optimize or transform them before publishing to a package/registry.
- Keep each SVG minimal (no inline CSS, avoid `id` collisions). If you need a more complex icon, discuss with the Icon Owner.
